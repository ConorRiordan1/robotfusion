Fusion of LiDAR and Computer Vision for Autonomous Navigation in Gazebo

notes:
- everything within the "turtlebot3_ws" folder should be enough for simulation in gazebo. everything outside of the folder is mainly related to real world application, with the exception of the gazebo models I made myself.

Here are some sources to check out:
